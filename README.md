### Work throughout the years

I’m a QA professional with over 6 years of experience in the game industry, working on PC, console, and mobile titles across multiple genres, using Unity and Unreal Engine.
My expertise lies in designing efficient test strategies, identifying and reproducing complex bugs, and collaborating with development teams to ensure stable releases. My experience also includes working in Player Support, where I developed strong communication and analytical skills by interpreting player reports through descriptions, screenshots, videos, and logs — greatly enhancing bug resolution during Live Ops and Early Access stages. Also, leading the QA Team during releases, training new additions to the team, showing how to test, record, write bugs, create test cases, making sure their questions are heard, and if they have their needs met to ensure a smooth testing cycle.
Recently, I expanded into game localization (English to Brazilian Portuguese), which sparked a new professional interest and broadened my capabilities. Additionally, I contributed to the development of Fortnite Creator-Made Islands for the LEGO® Summer Arcade Series competition, combining creativity and technical knowledge in a new way.
