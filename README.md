### Work throughout the years

I've worked for more than 5 years as a QA in the game industry, on PC, consoles and mobile games across different genres based on Unity and Unreal.
Throughout these years I learned how to find the best routes to test new features, how to figure out the reproduction methods of bugs the players bring us and the ones we find while testing. On my first workplace as a Player Support I learned how to better understand player needs and the bugs they find via their descriptions, screenshots, videos and logs, this pairs nicely with the QA work as it allows direct contact with players and speeds up bug resolution on Live Ops games and Early Access.
Most recently, I had the opportunity to engage in game localization from English to Portuguese, which sparked a new passion of mine and expanded my skill set. 

### Tools used through the years:
